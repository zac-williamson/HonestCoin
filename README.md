# HonestCoin, the 100% Honest and Fair ICO
HonestCoin is the hottest new ICO contract that issues tokens in exchange for ether (1:1 ratio for simplicity)

Because the creators of HonestCoin care about transparency, they gaurantee their contract has the following features:

## Deposited Ether can only be claimed after 6 months
There is a build in check which ensures that the withdrawFromEscrow() function can only be called after 6 months worth of blocks have elapsed since contract creation. This ensures creators have an incentive to, you know, create.
## For the first 5 months, users can vote on whether the 'freeze' the ICO.
If the vote to freeze passes, users can prevent ICO creators from withdrawing ether! Users can even withdraw their own initial ether once the contract is frozen. Clearly with such a contract design, the ICO creators have every incentive to keep their investors happy!
## Users can even transfer the ICO to another person
The HonestCoin creators are so *confident* that they will deliver, they have built in a transfer function! Anybody can initiate a vote to transfer ownership of the ICO to a nominated address. Users can then vote to voice their approval. If the total votes > half the ICO balance, ICO ownership is transferred to the new address. This ensures that the ICO is controlled by the *worthiest* individual!
## The ICO will have two rounds, each lasting for a week
This is hard-coded into the HonestCoin smart contract, ensuring the ICO owners cannot continue opening up ICO rounds, diluting previous investors.
