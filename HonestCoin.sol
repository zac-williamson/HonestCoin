    //         Users can vote 'yes' or 'no' to an ICO freeze and at the end of 5 months the votes can be tallied to determine whether the ICO is fronzen
    //         Since the owner can only withdraw the ether after 6 months, this seems very reasonable!
    //Bug A:   In resolveVote(), votes are tallied by iterating over an array of all voters. For a popular ICO the cost of iterating over this array will quickly
    //         exceed the block gas size limit, preventing a vote from ever being resolved: the ICO can never be frozen.
    //Bug B:   Even if resolveVote() can be run without hitting the block gas limit, the ICO creators can always win the vote
    //         in the 'for' loop, the iterator 'i' is declared as a variant and assigned to 0, which is considered an 8 bit character byte.
    //         this means that the 'for' loop will never finish executing, assuming votes.length > 256, creating an infinite loop.
    //         the ICO creators can always ensure that they personally mine the block which creates the HonestICO contract, assuming they have access to a mining rig
    //         under this assumption, they can also ensure that there are at least 256 voters by adding the relevent functions to the transaction list which includes their ICO creation
